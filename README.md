## Pages and Functionality

### Main Pages

1. **secondthoughts.html**: This is the introductory page of the website where users can find an overview of what the site offers.

2. **main.html**: Displays different adventure activities available for users to explore.

3. **Food and Wine Tour Page**: Provides details on food and wine tours, although the page structure and content are yet to be fully integrated.

4. **Destinations Page**: Features a grid of global destinations. Each destination is clickable and redirects to a specific city package page. The available destinations include:
   - **Argentina**

5. **Contact Page**: Allows users to reach out with inquiries or comments.

### Destinations Page Details

The Destinations page showcases various countries through images and brief descriptions. Each image is clickable and redirects to a page specific to the destination. For example:
- Clicking on the Argentina image leads to `packages ARG.html`.
- Clicking on the Japan image leads to `packages JAPAN.html`.

Each city package page subsequently links to a booking page for users to finalize their travel arrangements.


## Development

- **HTML/CSS**: The site uses HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Ensure that styling is consistent across pages and responsive to different devices.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for interactive elements such as image clicks leading to new pages. Verify that scripts work across different browsers and devices.
