                    <h3><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>Windsor Castle</h3>
                    <p>Windsor is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is strongly associated with the English and succeeding British royal family, and embodies almost a millennium of architectural history.

                        The original castle was built in the 11th century, after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I (who reigned 1100–1135), it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century state apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as "a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste".[1] Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be "one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic" design</p>

                    <p>Primarily known as a city full of British intellect and architecture, Cambridge is home to some of the oldest colleges in England, including the grand 16th century Gothic King’s College Chapel, and the elegant Tudor Trinity College. The ancient colleges are situated along The River Cam, which runs through the heart of Cambridge and is one of the cities absolutely must do, quintessentially British experiences – punting. Rowing down the river whilst sipping a Pimms or two is a great way to see the city. And in the evening? Grab your bikes and head to one of the many traditional pubs dotted along the cobbled streets.
