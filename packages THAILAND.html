                    <h3><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>Bangkok</h3>
                    <p> For most travelers, an adventure in Thailand will likely kick off in the nonstop, energetic capital city, Bangkok. A dizzying destination and one of my favorite international cities, Bangkok is full-on sensory overload — but in the best way. Dig into sizzling street food; meander back alleys and bustling thoroughfares in search of small markets, shops, and hidden temples; cruise along the Chao Phraya River, and grab a cocktail at the dozens of sky-high rooftop bars. 

                        Tip: Book a room at the Capella Bangkok or Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok — two iconic luxury hotels with stunning locations perched on the Chao Phraya River.</p>

The spectacular city is bursting with temples (Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is a must) and humming with restaurants and bars. </p>

                    <p>Thailand has more than 1,400 islands scattered around its coastline, but few are as famous or iconic as the Phi Phi Islands in the Andaman Sea. Comprising two islands — Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Leh — Koh Phi Phi is known for its natural beauty, excellent diving, and raucous party scene. For the latter, Phi Phi Don is the most famous. Phi Phi Leh, meanwhile, is uninhabited and beloved by those looking to disappear into nature. It was blasted into the public eye about two decades ago, when Leonardo DiCaprio's character went in search of an island paradise in the film "The Beach," which is set in real-life Maya Bay.</p>

                    <p>While we’re on the topic of Koh Phi Phi, we’d be remiss not to mention Krabi province as a whole. Located in southern Thailand, bordering the Andaman Sea, Krabi is home to many of the beautiful beaches and islands that make Thailand famous. 

                        "I've been booking many [trips to] Krabi lately," said Ekelund. "It ticks a lot of boxes for people. You've got the beauty, cool cliffs, and interesting geology. It has a beach, but it's for people who don't want to simply park it on the sand for 10 days. Krabi offers activities and more." Some highlights include the beach town of Ao Nang, as well as islands like Phuket, Koh Lanta, Koh Yao Yai, Koh Lipe, Railay Beach, and several national parks.</p>

                    <p>My first trip to Thailand was to the small island of Koh Yao Noi back in 2013. One of the most beautiful islands in Phang Nga Bay, Koh Yao Noi is flecked off the coast of its sibling island, Koh Yao Yai. Sandy beaches and small fishing villages comprise most of the land here, along with the luxe Six Senses Yao Noi resort tucked along the eastern coast. The property’s infinity pool is legendary for its explosive sunrise views that blur the distinction between the sky and sea.</p>

                    <p>Many Thai cities have the ability to make visitors feel like they’re stepping back in time. But few create the illusion as vividly as Ayutthaya. Once the capital of the Kingdom of Siam, the ruins of Ayutthaya are breathtaking and hauntingly beautiful. It’s only an hour from Bangkok, making it an easy day trip or a great overnight excursion.</p>

"We cycled around the ruins with a guide and got a great sense of the history. Sukhothai is much more rural and harder to reach, meaning it has fewer tourists. You also don't have a city built up around it."</p>

                    <p>Of all the places I've visited in Thailand, none stick with me as much as the Mae Hong Son Loop. This 300-mile route is most often tackled by travelers on the back of motorbikes looking to brave the mountain switchbacks that descend into the thick jungle and pass from small village to small village. It's not a journey to be taken lightly — motorbike experience is strongly recommended — but those who make the trip are rewarded with spectacular scenery and access to remote communities.</p>
